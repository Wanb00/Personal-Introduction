# Personal-Introduction

Hello!
I'm Wan, A junior developer utilising JavaScript with Node.js and browsers as environments. 
Feel free to have a look around my projects and their associated repositories and please checkout my portfolio webpage first!
Some projects were done as part of some self learning with freeCodeCamp with others being with Northcoders.
I'm passionate about building clean, purposeful code that will truly bring a difference to the user and dev experience.

## FAQs
Q: What were you doing prior to the bootcamp and self learning?

A: I graduated with a Bachelors in Medical Science from the University of Leeds in 2023, took a gap year and then decided to bridge into tech as I felt my interests were less in line with Research and Development.

Q: Why become a developer and not other tech roles?

A: During my 2nd and final year in my degree, I had two modules which worked on learning how to data analyse using C++ and Python. 
During these 2 modules, I found it quite fun to create something and problem solve any errors or issues I had along the way. 
Whilst this applies to many tech roles involved with programming, developer suited me more as I prefer seeing a visual result upon building something.

Q: Why did you choose to do a bootcamp?

A: Although the self directed learning using freeCodeCamp was great, I felt I was still lacking a lot of experience a junior developer would have compared to the things I learnt on freeCodeCamp.
What I felt I learnt from freeCodeCamp was mainly syntax of languages, but not so much in utilising software that I would and should know how to use on a daily bases such as VSCode.
Now that I have enrolled upon the Northcoders bootcamp I can happily say I was right! 
I've learnt a lot of technical skills off this bootcamp that I would have never gained through self-learning such as pair programming, hosting and using libraries that I never would have utilised by myself.
